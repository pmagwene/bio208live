```{r}
x <- 1:10
```

```{r}
plot(x)
```

Now I'm writing some prose.  How awesome is that?

It's really cool I have to say.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("~/Downloads/GSE11209_RAW/snyder.tsv", 
                 col_names = c("Chrom", "Seq","Start","End","Count"))
```

```{r}
str(data)
```

```{r}
str
```
