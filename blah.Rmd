```{r}
x <- 1:10
```

```{r}
plot(x)
```

Now I'm writing some prose.  How awesome is that?

It's really cool I have to say.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
data <- read_tsv("~/Downloads/GSE11209_RAW/snyder.tsv", 
                 col_names = c("Chrom", "Start","End", "Seq", "Count", "Strand"))
```

```{r}
str(data)
```

```{r}
data <- 
  mutate(data, Midpoint = (Start+End)/2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Midpoint, y = Count)) + 
  geom_point()
```
